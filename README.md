# Drug Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Drug Recommendation System built using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model provides personalized medicine recommendations based on user input. It updates ratings with new user inputs and recommends the top 5 drugs for each disease, assisting doctors in prescribing drugs with fewer side effects.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides drug recommendations tailored to individual user input.
- **Rating Updates**: Continuously updates drug ratings based on new user inputs.
- **Top 5 Drug Suggestions**: Recommends the top 5 drugs for each disease.
- **Side Effect Minimization**: Assists doctors in prescribing drugs with fewer side effects.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
